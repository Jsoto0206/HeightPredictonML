# HeightPredictonML
an example Machine Learning Project to demonstarate how to use KNN classification to predict values 


This project was created using Google collab, a notebook system similar to jupyter. Due to this I'm unsure if this project does work in traditional Python development environments but this is a list of all imports used
Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
Sklearn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
